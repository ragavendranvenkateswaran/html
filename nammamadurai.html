    <h1> NAMMA MADURAI </h1>
    <p>It is narrated in legend that Madurai was originally a forest known as Kadambavanam. One day, a farmer named Dhananjaya who was passing through the forest, saw Indra (The king of the gods), worshipping a swayambhu (self created Lingam ) under kadamba tree. Dhananjaya, the farmer immediately reported this to King Kulasekara Pandya. Kulasekara Pandya cleared the forest and built a temple around the Lingam. A city was soon planned with the temple as its centre. On the day the city was to be named, Lord Shiva is said to have appeared and drops of nectar from his hair fell on the town. So, the place was named Madurai – mathuram meaning “sweetness” in Tamil.</p>

    <img src="https://www.abhibus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Madurai-Meenakshi-Temple-History-Timings-How-to-Reach.jpg" alt=""width=25% height="250px">
    <p>Meenakshi Amman Temple, temple complex in Madurai, Tamil Nadu state, India, said to originally date as far back as the 4th century CE but in its present form built in the 16th–17th centuries. According to Hindu legend, the god Shiva came to Madurai in the form of Sundareswarar to marry Meenakshi, the daughter of the Pandya ruler; Meenakshi was a manifestation of the goddess Parvati. The Meenakshi Amman Temple is dedicated to their union.

        The massive temple is enclosed by high walls entered through soaring gopuras, or gateway towers. Inside are colonnades, columned mandapas (halls, some of which were used for shops, storerooms, and stables), a sacred tank, lesser shrines, and, at the centre, the two main shrines to Sundareswarar and Meenakshi. The gopuras are some of the most elaborately decorated in India. Brightly painted, they are completely covered with figures of divinities, celestial beings, monster masks, guardians, and animal mounts. The tallest of the 14, the southern gopura, rises to more than 170 feet (52 m).</p>
        <h2>2.Tirumalai Nayakkar Palace</h2>

        <p>The stunning Tirumalai Nayakkar Palace was considered to be one of the wonders of the South! Built in 1638 AD by King Tirumala Nayaka, the palace is a fusion of Italian and Rajput style architecture and is located to the southeast of the Meenakshi Amman temple. The original palace where the king resided was four times as large when compared to the one we see today! Inscriptional evidence in the temple points to a history as a Jain cave. Other theories suggest that the Murugan temple existed much before the 6th century, and was converted into a Jain shrine by Jain monks under the aegis of Pandya king Koon Pandiyan. The temple was later converted into a Hindu temple under the tutelage of Gajapathy, the minister of a later Pandya King, during the latter part of the 8th century. The temple received several additions during the regime of Madurai Nayaks, who commissioned the pillared halls in the temple.[4] As of 2021, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu.[5][6]</p>

        <p>Tiruppanrankundram is a town located 7 kilometres from Madurai city and is home to numerous ancient and historical monuments. However, the name is more synonymous with the enormous monolithic rock hill that stands at the height of 1048ft with a circumference of 3.2 kilometres!

            Also called Skandamalai, the hill contains many of the earliest cave temples of Shaivism, along with ancient Jain beds and Tamil Brahmi inscriptions.

             <p>Madurai Tamil Sangam, also known as the fourth Tamil Sangam,[1] was a language academy founded by Prince Pandithurai Thevar and other Tamil language scholars to promote the use of Tamil language and Tamil culture in the late 19th century in British held India.

                It was modeled after the legendary Sangams of Madurai city as mentioned in ancient Tamil literature. As there were three Tamil Sangams before, this one was considered to be the fourth one. It held exams to confer Tamil Pandithar degree on those who passed. Swami Vipulananda a noted Sri Lankan Tamil social reformer was one of the earlier Tamil Pandithars as recognized by the academy. It also published a scholarly journal called Centamil.

Damodaram Pillai, and others brought to light many of the ancient Tamil works which had hitherto remained in obscurity. Madurai Tamil Sangam is still functioning in the Tamil sangam road, Madurai.[2][3][4] The present president of Madurai Tamil Sangam is King of Mugavai. Mannar Na. Kumaran Sethupathi, vice president is Dr. N. sethuraman and secretary is S. Mariappa Murali.[5]</p>

It is one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshiped as Kallazhagar and his consort Lakshmi as Thirumamagal.[1]Kallazhagar Temple covers an area of about 2 acres (0.81 hectares) and has a five-tiered gopuram (gateway tower). The temple is enclosed in a rectangular enclosure with huge granite walls. The central shrine houses the image of the presiding deity, Sundarabahu Perumal in standing posture. The images of Sridevi and Bhudevi are also housed in the sanctum. There are two life size images of Narasimha, the avatar of Vishnu.

                        The tank is connected to Vaigai River through an ingenious system of underground Channels. It has total of 12 long stairs (steps) made of granite on all four sides. The temple as well as the stairs was built by the King Thirumalai Nayak. In the centre of the tank there is a Madapam called Maiya Mandapam (Central Mandapam) with Vinayakar temple and garden.[1]This is the location where the king Thirumalai Naicker excavated the soil to fabricate the bricks required for constructing his palace, Thirumalai Nayakkar Mahal. The pit that was thus formed is seen as tank now. It is approximately 305 m long and 290 m wide, nearly equal area to that of Meenakshi Amman Temple. Built in 1645 A.D.,this is the biggest tank in Tamil Nadu.[2] 7 foot tall Mukuruny Vinayakar idol in Meenakshi Amman Temple is believed to be found during excavation process of this pond.[This is the location where the king Thirumalai Naicker excavated the soil to fabricate the bricks required for constructing his palace, Thirumalai Nayakkar Mahal.
