               <p>The Subramaniam temple at Thiruparunkundram is situated six miles south of Madurai. It is a cave-temple located up on a small hill which was built in the 8th century by a king named Maravarman Sundara Pandiyan. Murugan is worshipped as Subramaniyan at the shrine, and this is where he got married to Deivanai, the daughter of Lord Indra.So Lord Shiva emitted divine fire sparks from his third eye, which represents the element of space, while Agni(the fire God) and Vayu(the Wind God) carried the sparks and dropped them into the sacred River Ganges. The divine mother Ganges carried the sparks in the form of flowing water into the Saravana Poikai Lake, where the sparks were split into six infants. Each infant was placed into their own beautiful Lotus and nurtured by six women called Karthigai Pengal. These women later reached the constellation as six stars. Goddess Parvathi watched the beautiful infants grow, and she embraced all the six boys and gave them one form of Lord Murugan with six heads, and twelve hands. This form of Lord Murugan is known as Arumuga Swami. Fridays are considered auspicious for worshipping Lord Murugan. Kanda Shastii Kavasam is a hindu devotional song written by Devaraya Swamigal, a powerful piece of Tamil literature sung in praise of Lord Murugan.</p>

            <li>Thiruchendur Murugan Temple  (Thirucheeralaivaai) - Thiruchendur, Thoothukudi district </li>

            <p>The main shrine of Murugan is called Senthinathan, and the two Utsava murtis of Thiruchendur Murugan are Jayanthi Nathar and Shanmukhar. Of all the six abodes, this is the only abode located near the seashore. Lord Murugan destroyed the asura Surapadman here, using his Vel(spear) given to him by his mother Parvathi. He also used the Vel in the naazhi kinaru (sacred well) to get water for the people when there was a drought. The Naazhi Kinaru is located south of the temple and devotees use the well water to cleanse themselves prior to worshipping the deity. The Soorasamharam festival is celebrated every year, rejoicing the victory over Surapadman and the asuras by Skanda, combined with the Kandha Shasti festival.</p>

            <li>Palani Murugan Temple (Thiruvavinankudi) - Pazhani, Dindigul district </li>

            <p>Lord Murugan enshrines as Lord Dandayuthapaani holding a staff (Dandam) in the popular hill temple of Palani. According to ancient mythology, the origin of the temple is based on a story where the sage Naratha presented the fruit of Knowledge (Gnana pazham) to Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva decided to give to one of his sons Ganesh and Muruga, and held a competition between the both of them. The competition was that the fruit would be handed over to the son who first circled the world three times. Murugan immediately took his vahana(vehicle), the peacock, and fled to circle the world. But to Lord Ganesh, the world is his parents and nothing else meant more to him. Hence, he walked around his parents thrice, and won the fruit of Knowledge. When Murugan returned, he found that his elder brother had already won the fruit. Out of sheer disappointment and frustration, he left Kailash and stood atop the Palani Hills.</p>

            <li> Swamimalai Murugan Temple (Thiruverakam) - Swamimalai, kumbakonam</li>

             <p>Lord Murugan is worshipped as Balamurugan and as Swaminatha Swami. The temple is said to be the place where Murugan preached the meaning of the Pranava Mantra “OM” to his father Lord Shiva. Hence this abode is known for its uniqueness, where the son is the teacher and the father is the student. The vahana of Murugan in this abode is an elephant instead of the peacock, and it is believed that the elephant, named Airavatha, was gifted to Murugan by Lord Indra.Once there was a demon (Asura) named Tarakasura, who was very powerful and defeated all the devas and enslaved them. Tarakasura, through his penance, got a boon from Lord Brahma that he can only die at the hands of the son of Lord Shiva. To save the devas from the asuras, Lord Shiva created a powerful form who would not only defeat Tarakasura, but also become a universal teacher, possessing the highest levels of knowledge.</p>

            <p>Lord Murugan enshrines in this temple as Tanikaslam. In this abode, he got back his inner peace after the war with the asuras. The name Thiruthani means "blissful repose" and it is here that Lord Muruga met Valli and fell in love with her. The divine marriage between Lord Murugan and Sri Valli took place in this abode. The main festival of the temple is Aadi Karthigai, where thousands of devotees carry kavadees (a wooden structure) on their shoulders. The kavadee is symbolic of burdens going on in one’s life, and devotees pray to the Lord to remove their burdens or sufferings. The devotees cheerfully carry the kavadee, singing devotional songs of Muruga, and dance their way up to the temple.Lord Murugan enshrines in this temple as Tanikaslam.

            <p>Lord Murugan in this shrine is known as Kurinji Nilam Kizhavan, and stands along with his consorts Deivanai and Valli, which makes it the only temple amongst the six abodes where he blesses his devotees along with his consorts. The temple is also known as Solaimalai temple, and stands on the slopes of the Alagar hills, about twelve miles east of Madurai. The temple has three shrines worshipping Lord Ganesha, Lord Murugan with his consorts, and Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva is called Panchaanana, meaning the Lord with five heads. Those five heads represent the five elements of nature, namely, Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Space. Combine these five elements with Shakti (Pure Consciousness), and Lord Murugan was born. He is called Shadaanana means the six-headed.

            <p>Palani is the most sacred religious abode of Lord Daņdāyudhapāni. Attracting people in large numbers regardless of their religious faiths and breaking language barriers, Palani is a powerful religious healing centre. A scholar thus remarked of Palani as having "a past steeped in antiquity, legend, mythology, epic battles, stories of great sages echoing the days gone by and in time honoured literature".

                Put these together and you have Palani, the temple of Lord Daņdāyudhapāni on Śivagiri Hill, a part of the Eastern Ghat range of hills in Tamil Nadu, located at an elevation of about 1500 feet above seal level.</p>

             <p>From time immemorial the Palani temple has been sanctified by the penance of sages and siddhas, favoured by the patronage of kings and nobles and finally glorified by the enraptured songs in praise of Lord Daņdāyudhapāni by Tamil poets. The vibrant spiritual atmosphere combined by the traditional rituals, helps to preserve the Hindu way of life without even the slightest sign of disturbance. The hundreds of thousands of pilgrims visiting this temple bears ample testimony.

                Out of the six sacred bastions (Paṭai Vīṭukaḷ) of Lord Murukan, Lord Daņdāyudhapāni at Palani represents the third stage of spiritual attainment, called the manipūrakam, the other stages of spiritual progress being:</p>

              <p>The basic, and the foremost factor is the presiding deity, known as the mūlavar. It is a normal practice to sculpt the idols for all Hindu temples in granite stone. The main reason to choose granite is it's tensile strength. But other than this enormous strength, only granite stone contains all the five elements of creation, namely the panc~a bhūta-s. They are earth, water, fire, air and ether.

                As an exception, in Palani the idol for the mūlavar or presiding deity is believed to be made out of an amalgam known as nava pāśaņam. In Sanskrit the word nava has two meanings. Nava means both 'new' and also 'nine'. Similarly the word bhāśaņa also has two meanings. Bhāśaņa means 'poison' and may also mean 'mineral'.</p>

             </center>
             <p>The observations made by the researchers who delved into the ancient literature lends support to the theory that the siddha munivar Bhogar was the one who formulated this amalgamation of nava pāśaņam. The idol for the presiding deity was sculpted out of this nava pāśaņam. It is believed that this amalgam is a clever mixture of nine poisonous metals. By this amalgamation, the poisonous nature of all these metals was harnessed, hardened like granite and converted into a beneficial amalgam with medicinal and curative values. The idol for the presiding deity was subsequently carved out of this hardened amalgam.

                To evolve such an unique amalgam reveals the alchemy expertise possessed by the siddha munivar Bhogar, the enormous spiritual heights achieved by him and the endless concern he had about the welfare of the followers devoted to Lord Murukan in future generations. The antecedent of this saint is seen from the very ancient literature. The bull god, Nandi Deva, is the supreme head of all siddhas. His main disciple was Tirumoolar amongst the total of seven. The seventh disciple is Kālāngi Kañjamalaiyan who in turn had five disciples. Kālāngi Kañjamalaiyan's disciple was the siddha munivar Bhoga</p>
